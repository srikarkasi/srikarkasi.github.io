**Short Bio:** I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Princeton University, working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://paws.cs.princeton.edu/">PAWS</a> research group, advised by Prof. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~kylej/">Kyle Jamieson</a>. Prior to joining Princeton, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in 2018 with B.Tech in Electrical Engineering.

**Research Interests:** 5G and nextG Wireless Networks, Quantum Computing, Graph Theory.

My research involves design, implementation, and evaluation of quantum computational algorithms for wireless cellular baseband processing with focus on quantum hardware design. My further efforts make the case for the future feasibility of quantum processing based cellular radio access networks in terms of cost and power.
